## Terraform VPC + Lambda Sample

This directory contains two sample templates authored using Terraform. One template is an AWS Proton Environment Template that will construct a VPC. The second template is an AWS Proton Service Template that will construct a Lambda function inside of that VPC.

If you need help deploying this, head to [aws-samples/aws-proton-terraform-github-actions-sample](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-proton-terraform-github-actions-sample) where we provide a walkthrough for running Self-managed provisioning options for executing Terraform through AWS Proton.
